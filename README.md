# The Algonauts Project 2025

The Algonauts Project 2025 challenge assesses computational models' ability to predict fMRI-recorded brain activity during exposure to **multimodal naturalistic movies**, leveraging a curated subset of the CNeuroMod dataset. This dataset includes:

**Training data:**

- 80 hours per subject of fMRI responses
- Episodes from Seasons 1-6 of *Friends*
- Three feature films
- One documentary

**Evaluation data:**

- Season 7 of *Friends* (in-distribution test)
- Novel movies with distinct narrative/content features (out-of-distribution generalization test)

The challenge emphasizes **OOD generalization** as the primary selection criterion for winning models, pushing beyond traditional within-distribution performance metrics. This structure enables direct comparison between biological and artificial intelligence systems' capacity to handle complex, real-world sensory inputs.
