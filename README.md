# algonauts_2025_challenge

The goal of the 2025 challenge is to provide a platform for biological and artificial intelligence scientists to cooperate and compete in developing cutting-edge functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) encoding models. Specifically, these models should predict fMRI response to multimodal naturalistic movies, and generalize outside their training distribution.

The challenge is based on data from the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod), which has acquired the dataset that, to date, most intensively samples single-subject fMRI responses to a variety of naturalistic tasks, including movie watching.
